The claim is supported by concrete data (40% increase in installations, 15% cost reduction, improved capacity factors) and the warrant connecting installation/cost trends to capacity expansion is reasonable.

            rationale: "The inference is invalid. While the data shows cost competitiveness, it does not support the absolute claim of complete replacement by 2030 (only 6 years away). The claim lacks qualifiers and ignores significant barriers: existing infrastructure, grid integration challenges, storage limitations, and political/economic factors. The warrant (cost parity leads to rapid complete replacement) is too strong."

            rationale: "The inference is invalid. The data shows AI outperforming humans only in specific narrow tasks (image classification), but the claim extrapolates to 'fundamentally superior to human cognitive capabilities' in general. The warrant connecting narrow task performance to overall cognitive superiority is missing and deeply flawed. Human cognition includes reasoning, creativity, common sense, emotional intelligence, and adaptability across domains - none of which are evidenced by image classification benchmarks. This is a classic logical leap."
            suggested_action: "Revise to match the scope of evidence: 'These improvements demonstrate that artificial intelligence can outperform humans in specific narrow tasks like image classification, though this does not necessarily translate to broader cognitive capabilities.'

Extrapolating from one specialized task to 'all cognitive domains' and 'human-level reasoning' is an enormous logical leap. The timeframe (2 years) is extremely aggressive. The claim ignores fundamental challenges in AGI development, lacks qualifiers, and the warrant (performance in image classification predicts general intelligence) is deeply flawed."
            suggested_action: "Significantly revise the claim to match the evidence: 'Improvements in image classification suggest that AI systems may continue advancing in narrow computer vision tasks, though progress toward general reasoning capabilities remains uncertain and faces substantial technical challenges.'

The predicted complete replacement by 2030 (6 years) is inconsistent with acknowledged technical limitations in storage and grid infrastructure. The warrant (current 70% capability leads to 100% replacement in 6 years) ignores the stated challenges. The qualifier 'likely' is not enough to justify the absolute claim of complete replacement."
            suggested_action: "Revise to align with the evidence: 'Given that variable renewables can reliably supply up to 70% of grid demand with existing technology, and considering ongoing challenges in storage and grid infrastructure, renewable energy could potentially provide a majority share of generation over the next 10-15 years, though complete replacement of fossil fuels will require significant advances in storage technology and grid infrastructure.'"
