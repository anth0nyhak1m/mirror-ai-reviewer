              - "# Rand Project AIR FORCE"
          - chunks:
              - "In recent years, RAND Project AIR FORCE (PAF) has supported the U.S. Air Force's efforts to enhance its talent management practices through technology investments (Schulker et al., 2022; Snyder, 2022; Yeung et al., 2022)."
              - "Prior work and these investments indicate that leveraging emerging technology can transform the USAF's talent management system."
              - "It has been shown that technology investments (Schulker et al., 2022; Snyder, 2022; Yeung et al., 2022) can materially improve the effectiveness of personnel management processes."
          - chunks:
              - "Building on this foundation, PAF developed a prototype tool, the Personnel Records Scoring System (PReSS), by leveraging existing technology and data sources."
              - "PReSS was tested with select Developmental Teams (DTs) and, in comparative evaluations, was found to be approximately 20 percent more effective than the baseline approach in improving talent management outcomes."
          - chunks:
              - "To further interrogate performance drivers, we conducted additional testing that extended the analysis to an eigenvalue framework to explore whether additional factors materially influence predictions of PReSS effectiveness."
              - "The eigenvalue analysis indicated that these additional factors were not important in predicting effectiveness."
              - "This suggests that, while advanced mathematical methods can be used to predict the effectiveness of the PReSS system, they do not appear to be necessary for achieving strong results in this context."
          - chunks:
              - "Taken together, these projects demonstrate that leveraging technology can transform talent management, while careful methodological choices help ensure robustness without unnecessary complexity."
              - "In this report, we describe improvements to PReSS and an expansion of its application to enlisted personnel."
              - "B.F. Skinner makes particularly relevant contributions to this topic through his work on operant conditioning."
          - chunks:
              - "Where appropriate, we reference publicly available standards and guidance (e.g., National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Pentagon, 2022) to align terminology and methodological expectations with broader practice."
